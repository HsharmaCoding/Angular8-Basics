1. Template Driven Form (TDF)
    > All the contentt will be in html file.
    > It is just similar what we use in AngulareJS
    > Depends on propject requirement we can choose the approach.
    > Here we will perform following items:
        > Data binding
        > Track state and validity
        > Display error message
        > Posting data to server 
        > etc.

2. Add bootsrtap css in the project.
    > Go to the bootsrtap website and copy the bootsrtap cdn (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/)
    > Add bootsrtap CDN in index.html file.

3. Create Simple HTML Form with controls.
4. import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms'; in app.modele.ts
    > Also add FormsModule in imports array in same file.
5. Declare the form with template refference valriable to make it angular form. <form #userForm="ngForm">
    > Apply noModel in html control to make two way binding.
    > all control should have the name property.
    > Create form group using ngModelGroup
        > By that form will be showing in group. Single objec > another single object within parent object.
6. Bind Form Data To a Model.
    > Bind data to the user defined model then send that data to the server. (Bind)

7. Track Control State and validity

    State                                       Class if true               class if false
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The control has been visited                ng-touched                  ng-untouched
    The control's value has been changed.       ng-dirty                    ng-pristine
        Ex: If the value is changes then class
            applied from perstine to dirty.
    The control's value is valid.               ng-valid                    ng-invalid
        Ex: If control has required validation
             but the value is not there then it
             will apply the ng-invalid class.

    > Observe the form state by simply assigning the template referrence variable #name
    > Observe the form state by #nme="ngModel" and {{name.{Property name eg. touced, valid}}}

8. Form level validation and and enable/disable submit button.
9. Apply bootsrtap claseed to display redborder and other validation example : class.is-invalid
10. Make onSubmit event to submit the date and observe the submitted object on console.
    > Create enrollment service to post the data. we will inject that service in our comnponent to make post call.
    > Now we don't have API. we will create blue print to make API call from service.
    > Whenever we have API url then just need to replace the url then code will be working.
    > Command : ng g s enrollment  to generate service.
